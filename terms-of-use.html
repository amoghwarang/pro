            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using the Moodie service, website, or any applications made available by Moodie (collectively, the "Moodie Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you should not access or use the Moodie Service.</p>

We will notify you of any such changes by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Moodie website and changing the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms of Use. Your continued use of the Moodie Service following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>

            <h2>3. Privacy</h2>

            <p>We may offer a number of membership plans, including memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>5. Free Trials</h2>
            <p>Your Moodie membership may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your membership lasts for one month, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. Free trials are for new and certain former members only. Moodie reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.</p>
            <p>We will charge your Payment Method for your monthly membership fee at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your membership prior to the end of the free trial period.

            <h2>6. Billing and Cancellation</h2>
            <p><strong>Billing Cycle.</strong> The membership fee for the Moodie Service will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on your "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment Methods.</strong> To use the Moodie Service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated with your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method.</p>
            <p><strong>Cancellation.</strong> You can cancel your Moodie membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Moodie Service through the end of your billing period. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.</p>
